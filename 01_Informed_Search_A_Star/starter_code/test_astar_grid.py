Tests for astar_grid.py

Run with:
    pytest 01_Informed_Search_A_Star/starter_code/test_astar_grid.py -v

`test_given_example` below is COMPLETE -- study it as a template.

You must then write the 3 required test cases (test_case_1, test_case_2,
test_case_3). Read ../../03_Test_Case_Design/mindmap.md and
training_guide.md before choosing what your 3 cases should cover. Aim to
pick 3 *different* categories (e.g. one typical/normal case, one
edge/boundary case, one unsolvable-or-stress case) rather than 3 variations
of the same thing.

For each test case, write a short comment explaining WHICH category from
the mind-map it represents and WHY you chose it.
